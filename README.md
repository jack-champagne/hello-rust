# My journey into rust!

This is my first steps at taking a good look at a language that has proved to be very well-liked amoung its developers. This readme will be periodically updated to include information on what I have learned and completed and where I am headed next.


Most of this code is taken from the rust-lang documentation book (if you have rust installed, it can be accessed at ```$ rustup docs --book```).


To use this project, clone this repository and move into the directory that you would like to build the chapters code in. For directories without a Config.toml, use rustc to compile.

Just finished chapter one and am looking to see more of the language (not looking to write a project right now). I am going to skip on to chapter three before I get my hands dirty. So far, I really like the built in documentation and book as well as their package management system/build system and direct level rustc compiler. It is greatly convienent and refreshing for some one who has struggle with ruby gems and the ruby development toolchain in the past on my Windows machine to see something so plug and play.
